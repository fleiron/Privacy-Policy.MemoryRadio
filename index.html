  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: July 2, 2025</em></p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>MemoryRadio</strong> (the "App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not collect personally identifiable information</strong> (such as name, email, or phone number). The data you optionally enter (such as preferences or usage data) is stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device and never transmitted to external servers.</p>
  <p>We may collect <strong>anonymized technical data</strong> for analytics and crash reporting, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>App version and device model</li>
      <li>Usage data (e.g., which features are used)</li>
      <li>Purchase events (via RevenueCat)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>2. Purchases and Payments</h2>
  <p>The App offers premium content via a one-time purchase priced at $4.99 USD (or equivalent in other countries, e.g., $5.99). This purchase grants you lifetime access to all premium features.</p>
  <p>Purchases are securely processed by Apple. We do not collect or store your payment information.</p>
  <p>Purchase status is managed via <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service that uses anonymous User IDs and may use device identifiers for fraud prevention and purchase validation purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We follow industry-standard practices to ensure data integrity and security. Since the app stores data locally and does not collect personal data, privacy risks are minimized.</p>

  <h2>4. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties. Anonymized purchase-related events may be shared with RevenueCat strictly to operate and support in-app purchases.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can manage or restore your purchase at any time through your Apple ID account settings.</p>

  <h2>6. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is not intended for children under 13 years old and does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:<br/>
    ðŸ“© <a href="mailto:ilushazs@icloud.com">ilushazs@icloud.com</a></p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to manage in-app purchases. RevenueCat may collect anonymized data such as purchase history, product interaction, and device information solely for app functionality, analytics, and fraud prevention.</p>
  <p>This data is <strong>not used for tracking across apps or for advertising purposes</strong>.</p>
